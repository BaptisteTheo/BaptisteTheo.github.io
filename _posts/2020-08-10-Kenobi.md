# Kenobi

## Through this box we are going to learn :
- How to scan a website with nmap.
- Using nmap to launch a script to enumerate samba shares.
- Gain access with ProFtpd.
- Use Path Variable Manipulation for Privilege Escalation.

### Section 1 : Scanning 

As d'habitude, let's start with nmap.

![image](/assets/img/kenobi/nmap.png)

We can see that the machine is running on a webserver on port 80. 
Let's inspect the web page. 

![!image](/assets/img/kenobi/page.png)

Nothing fancy to see, we could use dirbuster to locate hidden page.

### Section 2 : Get information from the samba port.

Actually TryHackMe tells us to use a nmap scan and locate samba shares.

_We can see that there are 3 shares running_

The one that is most interesting is the anonymous one, that mean we can connect to it without login or password.
After connecting to it, I found a log.txt inside.

There is a lot of sensitive informations in this file.
- Infos gathered for Kenobi when a SSH key is generated for this user.
- Infos about the ProFTPD server.

### Section 3 : Gain access with ProFtpd
_ProFtpd is a free and open-source FTP server, compatible with Unix and Windows systems. Its also been vulnerable in the past software versions._

We know from the log.txt that ProFtpd is running on the port 21.
Let's use netcat to connect to the machine on the port 21.

We know that the version of ProFtpd running is the 1.3.5.
We have enough informations to find an exploit.
With searchsploit we maybe can find one.

The 'mod_copy' module is interesting, it allow us to use SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands, we can use this to copy files/directories from one place to another on the server. 

Any unauthenticated client can use these commands to copy files from any part of the filesystem to a chosen destination.

From our recon in the samba shares, we know that the FTP service is running as the user Kenobi and an ssh key is generated.

Let's copy the private ssh key with SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands.

We basically just moved the private key to the /var/tmp directory so we can mount it after.

Now we gonna mount the /var/tmp to our machine.

Since we successfully mounted the network on our machine, we can use the private key to login with the Kenobi account.

We are in ! We can look for Kenobi's user flag.

_That was easy, it's an easy machine, so obvioulsy the flag was inside the home directory_

### Section 4 : Priv esc with path variable manipulation

Like the Vulnversity machine, we are confronted with SUID file.
Let's look for them with the same command that I used before.

![image](/assets/img/kenobi/suid.png)

The /usr/bin/menu is suspicious, let's launch it to know what does it do.

We have a binary that launch direct command, we can then use the strings command to look inside the file what's going one. 

![image](/assets/img/kenobi/strings.png)

We see that the binary is running without a full path.
(not using /usr/bin/curl or /usr/bin/uname).

This file runs as the root privilges, we are gonna manipulate our path to gain a root shell.

![image](/assets/img/kenobi/root.png)
_We copied the /bin/sh shell, called it curl, gave it the correct permissions and then put its location in our path. This meant that when the /usr/bin/menu binary was run, its using our path variable to find the "curl" binary.. Which is actually a version of /usr/sh, as well as this file being run as root it runs our shell as root!_

### Section 5 : easter egg.

If you use DirBuster to scan the website.
You find a /admin.html path and if you go there :

Thanks Amiral Ackbar for the warning !
