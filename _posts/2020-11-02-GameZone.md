# Game Zone

## Through this box I learned :

- How to use basic SQL injection 
- Use Sqlmap to find hash
- Crack a hash password with John The Ripper
- Use ssh tunnel to redirect a webpage

### Section 1 : Scanning and Recon 

As always, start with a nmap scan.

There is a web server running, let's check the page.

_I realized after that the darkmode fucked up the image a little bit..._

Look's like a old video game site.

I'm gonna launch dirbuster to find hidden files or directory.

I found nothing intersting. Exept the portal.php, which can maybe accessible via the login section.

### Section 2 : Obtain access wia SQLi

We have a login space, let's try an SQL injection to enter the website
For the username you can use this :
```bash
' or 1=1 -- -
```
And leave the password blank.

We are in the Game Zone Portal now.

### Section 3 : Using SQLMap 
_SQLMap is a popular open-source, automatic SQL injection and database takeover tool._

First we need to intercept a request made to the search feature using BurpSuite.

Copy the output in a text file.

Then launch this sqlmap command : 
```bash
sqlmap -r <text.txt> --dbms=mysql --dump
```

- -r uses the intercepted request you saved earlier
- --dbms tells SQLMap what type of database management system it is
- --dump attempts to outputs the entire database

We have a text file with the hash stored.

### Section 4 : Crack Password with JohnTheRipper
_John the Ripper (JTR) is a fast, free and open-source password cracker._

Run the following to crack the hash
```bash 
john hash.txt --wordlist=/home/edwards/Downloads/rockyou.txt --format=Raw-SHA256
```

We can now try to connect with ssh, since with have a username and a password.

The user.txt will be avaible directly.

### Section 5 : Expose Service with reverse SSH tunnels
_Reverse SSH port forwarding specifies that the given port on the remote server host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side._

Let's use a tool called ss to see sockets running on a host
```bash
ss -tulpn 
```

![image](/assets/img/Game Zone/ss.png)

- -t	Display TCP sockets
- -u	Display UDP sockets
- -l	Displays only listening sockets
- -p	Shows the process using the socket
- -n	Doesn't resolve service names

On port 10000 a service is running, but it's blocked via a firewall rule from the outside.
We can use an SSH tunnel to expose the port to us.

Let's run : 
```bash
ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 <username>@<ip>
```

Then travel to localhost:10000 to see a login page.

I used the same credientals that for the ssh login.

With the version I found a metasploit exploit.

### Section 6 : Priv esc with Metasploit 

Let's launch metasploit and use the payload.

Inside the machin I imported an interactive terminal via Python.
```bash
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Then you can cat the root.txt

I never used SQL injection, so I was glad to see it for the first time.
