_Nmap ("Network Mapper") is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime._

## Nmap scan I frequently use (from the cyber mentor): 
```bash
nmap -T4 -p- -A <target_ip>
```

- **-T4** : For the speed of the scan (min -T0, max -T5)
- **-p-** : Scan all ports on the machine, so you don't miss anything.
- **-A**  : Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
             --datadir <dirname>: Specify custom Nmap data file location
             --send-eth/--send-ip: Send using raw ethernet frames or IP packets
             --privileged: Assume that the user is fully privileged
             --unprivileged: Assume the user lacks raw socket privileges
